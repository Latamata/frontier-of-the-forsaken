# 🌲 Oregon Trail Roguelite — Tactical Zombie Survival

A mashup of **roguelite mechanics**, **zombie survival**, and **Oregon Trail** vibes.  
Lead a line infantry through the undead frontier — fight, camp, and push west.

> WASD for movement, mouse for commanding. Survive the trail, one wave at a time.

- 🧍‍♂️ **WASD Movement**: Direct control over your lead character
- 🖱️ **Click + Drag Infantry Placement**: RTS-style controls for forming lines
- 🏕️ **Campaign Map**: Travel from camp to camp, each hosting randomized combat encounters
- 🧟 **Zombie Waves**: Enemies attack in growing intensity — survive and move on
